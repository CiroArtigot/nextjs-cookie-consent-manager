# Free npm package for manage the cookie consent on NextJS projects

## This package works with Google Consent Mode

> Google Cookie Consent Mode is a feature provided by Google that helps website owners handle the use of cookies and comply with privacy regulations. It allows website operators to configure their websites to work with Google's default behavior for handling cookies when users access their site via Google ads or services.

> When Cookie Consent Mode is enabled, Google handles the cookie consent process on behalf of the website owner. This means that Google will display a consent message to users, provide options for managing cookie preferences, and handle the storage and access of cookies based on the user's consent choices.

> By using Google Cookie Consent Mode, website owners can simplify their compliance efforts by leveraging Google's infrastructure and user interface for managing cookie consent. It helps ensure that website visitors receive consistent and transparent information about the use of cookies and have control over their privacy preferences.

> It's important to note that Google Cookie Consent Mode focuses on cookies related to Google services and ads. Website owners are still responsible for complying with regulations regarding other types of cookies and third-party services that may be used on their website.

> Sanity hosts your content in a real-time, hosted data store called Content Lake. [Get started](https://www.sanity.io/get-started) with the free plan with generous bandwidth and hosting included and pay-as-you-go for overages.
